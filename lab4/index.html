        <p class="content-p">The Neighbourhood is an American alternative rock/dark pop band that formed in Newbury Park, California, USA in August 2011. 
            The band consists of Jesse Rutherford, Jeremy Freedman, Zach Abels, and Mikey Margott. In early 2012 a mysterious band appeared online. 
            The group, The Neighbourhood, revealed no biographical information, no photos and no backstory, offering only a moody track 
            titled "Female Robbery". Fans and the press were confounded, scouring the Internet for any information that might lead them to the identity 
            of these musicians. Pieces of the puzzle, some reflecting reality and some not so much, began to emerge. The Neighbourhood were a quintet. 
            Mixing moody, '90s-style alt-rock with hip-hop and electronic flourishes, California's the Neighbourhood broke through with their debut 
            single "Sweater Weather."

        <p class="content-p">In 2012, the group released the EP I'm Sorry..., featuring such singles as "Sweater Weather" and "Female Robbery". Two more 
            EPs followed in 2013, leading up to the release of the Neighbourhood's full-length debut, I Love You. The following year, 
            the group's long-delayed mixtape album, #000000 & #FFFFFF, appeared as a free download online. Included on the set was the single 
            "icanteven" featuring French Montana. In 2015, the Neighbourhood issued their sophomore full-length, the Justyn Pilbrow-produced Wiped Out! 
            The Hard EP appeared in September 2017 and cracked the Billboard 200 as a surprise release. In 2018, the band delivered their third album, 
            the eponymously titled The Neighbourhood, which was anchored by the single "Scary Love". Two more EPs followed, To Imagine and Ever Changing, 
            with all three of the group's 2018 EPs later compiled into a release called Hard to Imagine the Neighbourhood Ever Changing. 
            The Neighbourhood continued their prolific streak, returning in 2019 with the acoustic single "Middle of Somewhere", followed in August 2020 
            with "Cherry Flavored". Both tracks were included on the group's fourth full-length, 2020's Bowie-esque sci-fi concept album Chip Chrome & 
            the Mono-Tones.
